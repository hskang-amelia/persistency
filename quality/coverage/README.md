# Coverage (consumer layer)

Unified C++ + Rust coverage via the qualified S-CORE coverage tool,
[`score_coverage`](https://eclipse-score.github.io/coverage_tool/main/). This
directory only holds what is specific to this repository:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BUILD` | `score_coverage_scope` (the production targets in scope) + `score_coverage_reporter` (LLVM tool wiring) |
| `coverage.bazelrc` | the `llvm_cov` config, imported from the root `.bazelrc` |
| `coverage_justifications.yaml` | reviewed justifications for intentionally uncovered lines (`COV_JUSTIFIED` markers) |

## Usage

```bash
bazel coverage --config=llvm_cov //score/... --build_tests_only

bazel run @score_coverage//:generate_coverage_html -- \
    --yaml quality/coverage/coverage_justifications.yaml --testlogs-subdir score

xdg-open coverage_linux/index.html
```

> Do NOT combine `--config=llvm_cov` with `--config=per-x86_64-linux`:
> the GCC toolchain would win resolution and produce no coverage data.

Untested in-scope files (e.g. `kvs_tool.rs`) appear at exact 0%; the gate
compares *effective* coverage (covered + justified) against
`COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` (CI: report-only during introduction, see
`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`).

Full documentation lives with the tool:
[user manual](https://eclipse-score.github.io/coverage_tool/main/manual/user_manual.html)
and
[architecture](https://eclipse-score.github.io/coverage_tool/main/architecture/index.html).
